To\\The BDO, Nuapada


\opening{Respected Sir,}

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to bring to your attention the deteriorating condition of the road in our locality, Nuapada. The road has been a crucial lifeline for our community, facilitating daily commutes, transportation of goods, and overall connectivity. Unfortunately, the current state of disrepair is causing significant inconvenience and safety concerns for the residents.

The road, particularly in Ram Mandir road, has developed numerous potholes, cracks, and uneven surfaces. This has not only made commuting a challenging task but has also led to damage to vehicles and posed risks to pedestrians. The overall condition of the road has worsened over time, adversely affecting the quality of life for the residents.

Considering the importance of a well-maintained road for the overall development of our locality, I earnestly request your intervention in initiating the necessary repairs. The timely restoration of this road will not only enhance the connectivity but also contribute to the safety and well-being of the residents.

I kindly request you to conduct a thorough assessment of the road's condition and allocate the necessary funds for its repair. The involvement of concerned authorities and timely action on this matter would be highly appreciated by the residents of [Locality Name].

\closing{Sincerely,\\Roshan Rajan Chand}
